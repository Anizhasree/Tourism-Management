Decisions made while developing the contracts

*	ERC20 token was chosen for the project, the tokens were required for the project functionalities.
*	Geth was chosen as the deployment test network, allowing us to test the different scenarios in the contract logic.
*	We started the concept by adding the products first then the user registration. The reason behind this was the products should be available to users after their account creations and registrations process.
*	We then collected the Customer Identity through KYC (Know Your Customer), like collecting the name, address, registered phone number, Aadhar number for Indian citizens, passport details for other country citizens. We need true details of each customers.
*	The tokens are easy for transfer than usual currency. This avoided the money denominations problems, different country has different denominations. The tokens were easy to handle and for sales.
*	We add the products as a matter of true relics and artifacts.
